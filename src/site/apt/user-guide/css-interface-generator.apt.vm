Generate Java Interface using the CSS Interface Generator from GWT

  With version 2.1.1, you can now generate Java Interfaces from css files.
  Your css must be located in resources referenced in the Maven pom
  The css filename is used to generate the Java class Name (so use the standard camel case).

  The java sources will be generated by default in $\{project.build.directory\}/generated-sources/gwt .
  You change it with modifying the generateDirectory mojo parameter.
