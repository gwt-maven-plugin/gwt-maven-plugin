Testing GWT code with Maven

  One special aspect of gwt-maven-plugin to be familiar with is that it runs its own special <<<test>>> goal
  in order to support <<<GWTTestCase>>> and <<<GWTTestSuite>>> derived GWT tests. If you're not familiar with
  GWT testing support you should first read the related
  {{{http://code.google.com/intl/fr/webtoolkit/articles/testing_methodologies_using_gwt.html}documentation}}.

  We do not consider GWTTestCase to be unit test as they require the whole GWT Module to run. For this reason, the <<<test>>> goal is
  bound by default to <<<integration-test>>> phase. But this is only our point of view and you may want to run such test during the
  standard <<<test>>> phase, and maybe use a profile and naming convention to execute such tests on demand.

  Another option is to {{{http://code.google.com/events/io/2009/sessions/GoogleWebToolkitBestPractices.html}use the MVP design pattern}}
   to keep your code and UI components separated. In such case,
  GWT {{{http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/source/browse/releases/2.1/user/src/com/google/gwt/junit/GWTMockUtilities.java}MockUtilities}}
  will help you disable Defered Binding (that requires a full GWT stack) and use mock components.

* Using Surefire

  It's a long story as to why a dedicated <<<gwt:test>>> is needed, but in few words the regular Maven Surefire
  testing plugin requires some complex setup to work fine with GWTTestSuites.
  If you really want to do so, here is a sample configuration :

+---
  <plugin>
    <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>2.6</version>
    <configuration>
      <additionalClasspathElements>
        <additionalClasspathElement>\${project.build.sourceDirectory}</additionalClasspathElement>
        <additionalClasspathElement>\${project.build.testSourceDirectory}</additionalClasspathElement>
      </additionalClasspathElements>
      <useManifestOnlyJar>false</useManifestOnlyJar>
      <forkMode>always</forkMode>
      <systemProperties>
        <property>
          <name>gwt.args</name>
          <value>-out \${webAppDirectory}</value>
        </property>
      </systemProperties>
    </configuration>
  </plugin>
+---

* Using gwt-maven-plugin <<<test>>> goal

  The gwt-maven-plugin testing support is <<not>> intended to be run standalone, rather it is bound to
  the Maven <<<integration-test>>> phase. To get <<<gwt:test>>> to run, you should include the"<<<test>>>
  goal in your plugin configuration executions, and you should invoke <<<mvn integration-test>>> (or <<<mvn install>>>).

+--
<project>
  [...]
  <build>
    <plugins>
      [...]
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
        <artifactId>gwt-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <goals>
              <goal>test</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
      [...]
    </plugins>
  </build>
  [...]
</project>

* Separate GwtTest tests from standard unit tests

  Because you will likely want to run <<both>> Surefire and gwt-maven-plugin based tests
  (for regular server side JUnit tests with Surefire, and for client model and controller tests with GWT)
  you need to distinguish these tests from each other. This is done using a naming convention.

  You can configure the Surefire plugin (responsible for running
  tests during maven build) to skip the GwtTests using some naming patterns :

+--
  <plugin>
    <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>2.6</version>
    <configuration>
      <excludes>
        <exclude>**/*GwtTest.java</exclude>
      </excludes>
    </configuration>
  </plugin>
+--

  A simplier way to separate classic and GWT tests is to name latests <<<GwtTest"Something.java>>>.
  As surefire looks for tests that are named <<<Something"Test".java>>> by default, they will be ignored during
  <<<test>>> phase.

  By default, the gwt-maven-plugin uses <<<GwtTest*.java>>> as inclusion pattern so that such testst will <<not>> match
  the standard Surefire pattern. Using this convention you don't have to change your configuration.

  To configure the plugin to use another naming convention, set the <<<includes>>> plugin parameter.

+--
  <plugin>
    <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
    <artifactId>gwt-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${project.version}</version>
    <configuration>
      <includes>**/CustomPattern*.java</includes>
    </configuration>
    <executions>
      <execution>
        <goals>
          <goal>test</goal>
        </goals>
      </execution>
    </executions>
  </plugin>
+--

* Test results output

  The plugin use the standard Surefire testrunner, and contributes to execution report. If you use
  the surefire-report-plugin, you will see the GwtTests result included in generated project site.

* About GwtTestSuite

  The {{{http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit-doc-1-5/wiki/DevGuideJUnitSuites}Official GWT documentation}}
  on TestSuites suggest to grouping your GWT tests in a suite by extending GwtTestSuite. Maven will not be able to
  run such a Suite. The snippet below is what will allow both the Eclipse Junit Runner and Maven to run the test cases.

+----
  public class MyGwtTestSuite extends TestCase /*note this is TestCase and not TestSuite */
  {
      public static Test suite()
      {
          GwtTestSuite suite = new GwtTestSuite( "All Gwt Tests go in here" );
          suite.addTestSuite( GwtTest1.class );
          return suite;
      }
+----

* Use GWTTestSuite padawan

  {{{http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/2.1/com/google/gwt/junit/client/GWTTestCase.html}<<<GWTTestCase>>>}}
  derived tests are slow. This is because the JUnitShell has to load the module for each test (create the shell, hook into it, etc).
  {{{http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/2.1/com/google/gwt/junit/tools/GWTTestSuite.html}<<<GWTTestSuite>>>}}
  mitigates this by grouping all the tests that are for the same module (those that return the same value for getModuleName) together and running them via the same
  shell instance.

  This is a <<big>> time saver, and <<<GWTTestSuite>>> is easy to use, so using it is a good idea. For this reason, the default value of the
  test inclusion pattern is <<<**/Gwt*Suite.java>>>.

  We recommend to name your test suite <<<GwtTestSuite.java>>> so that the test filter picks it up, but name the actual tests
  with a convention that Surefire will ignore by default - something that does <<not>> start with <<<GwtTest>>>, and does <<not>>
  start <or> end with <<<Test>>>. For example <<<MyClassTestGwt.java>>>. This way, gwt-maven-plugin picks up the <<<Suite>>>, and runs it,
  but does not also run individual tests (and Surefire does not pick it up either)

* testing modes

  GwtTestCase uses an invisible "headless" browser to run your code. As an option, you can run your code compiled to JavaScript instead
  of using the hosted mode bridge between Java and JavaScript, using the <<<productionMode>>> parameter. GWT Team suggest that you run your
  tests in both modes to detect {{{http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit-doc-1-5/wiki/DevGuideJavaCompatibility}differences between
  Java and JavaScript}}. You may configure your continuous integration server with <<<-Dgwt.test.prod=true>>> system property to check this.

  You can also use HTMLUnit as alternative to the embedded browser. {{{http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net/}HTMLUnit}} don't provide a full
  browser with GUI components, but is 100% Java based so don't require a native process and can run in your favorite debugger.
  To run tests with HTMLUnit, set the <<<mode>>> parameter (or <<<Dgwt.test.mode>>> system property) to "htmlunit". You can set
  the <<<htmlunit>>> with a list of emulated browsers - please not this is only emulation, always validate test results with a real browser.

+---
  <plugin>
    <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
    <artifactId>gwt-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${project.version}</version>
    <configuration>
      <htmlunit>IE6,IE7,IE8</htmlunit>
    </configuration>
  </plugin>
+---

* testing with "real" browsers

  Running headless is usefull, but when it fails you'll need to see what happen and use your own browser. In such case, use the manual mode
  using the <<<mode>>> parameter (or <<<Dgwt.test.mode>>> system property) to "manual". GWT will then print an URL to access from your browser.

  You may also want to test your code on various browser, not just the hosted mode embeded one. You then need a remote browser available
  for testing. See {{{http://code.google.com/intl/fr/webtoolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideTestingRemoteTesting.html}GWT documentation}} for more
  explanations.

  Selenium mode can be used for running your test suite on real browsers using Selenium RC. Set the <<<mode>>> parameter
  (or <<<gwt.test.mode>>> system property) to "selenium". Don't forget to configure the <<<selenium>>> parameter with the host running the Selenium RC
  browser :

+---
  <plugin>
    <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
    <artifactId>gwt-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${project.version}</version>
    <configuration>
      <selenium>myhost:4444/*firefox"</selenium>
    </configuration>
  </plugin>
+---

  Selenium may not fit your needs, then GWT comes with a custom RemoteBrowserServer. You can lauch such a server using <<<gwt:browser>>> goal,
  by default it will run Internet Explorer on a Windows box as "ie". You can then run your testsuite on this remote browser, by setting
  the the <<<mode>>> parameter (or <<<gwt.test.mode>>> system property) to "remoteweb". You'll have to configure the <<<remoteweb>>>
  parameter to declare your remoteBrowserServer :

+---
  <plugin>
    <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
    <artifactId>gwt-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${project.version}</version>
    <configuration>
      <remoteweb>rmi://myhost/ie</remoteweb>
    </configuration>
  </plugin>
+---
