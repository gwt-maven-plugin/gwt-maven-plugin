Using the Google Eclipse Plugin


  The {{{https://developers.google.com/eclipse/}Google Plugin for Eclipse}} is a nice integration of GWT inside
  Eclipse to make development easier. It can be used to launch the DevMode with a simple right click
  and provides several wizards and tools, and optionally the GWT Designer.

* Project layout

  Your maven project will end something like this. Please note the <<<Module.gwt.xml>>> module descriptor
  located in <<<src/main/java>>> directory :

+---
  pom.xml
  |_src
     |_main
        |_java
        |  |_ com/mycompany/gwt/Module.gwt.xml
        |  |_ com/mycompany/gwt/client
        |  |  |_ ModuleEntryPoint.java
        |_resources
        |_webapp
          | index.html
          |_WEB-INF
            |_web.wml
+---

* Maven configuration

  Your Maven configuration will be something like this :

+---
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0
		                     http://maven.apache.org/maven-v4_0_0.xsd">
  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
  <groupId>com.mycompany</groupId>
  <artifactId>webapp</artifactId>
  <packaging>war</packaging>
  <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>

  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.google.gwt</groupId>
      <artifactId>gwt-user</artifactId>
      <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.google.gwt</groupId>
      <artifactId>gwt-servlet</artifactId>
      <scope>runtime</scope>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>

  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
        <artifactId>gwt-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <goals>
              <goal>compile</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
        <configuration>
          <runTarget>index.html</runTarget>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
+---

  With this setup, you can start your GWT module with a single right-click in your Eclispe IDE with
  <Run as : Web application>.

  You can the edit your java code and just hit refresh to see changes applied in the browser.

* Eclipse configuration

  Import your maven project into eclipse using m2eclipse import wizard (or your prefered tooling). The
  Google Plugin for Eclipse should automatically enable the GWT nature on the project. If not, manually
  enable it from project preferences by setting the <<<Use Google Web Toolkit>>> checkbox (the GWT SDK should
  be picked from your POM).

* Multiproject setup

  Big projects may want to split the client-side application in modules, typically using Maven support for
  multiprojects. The project layout will the become something like this (maybe with some more classes) :

+---
  pom.xml // reactor project
  |_domain // shared with other (GWT or Java) projects
  |  |_src
  |    |_main
  |      |_java
  |      |  |_ com/mycompany/domain
  |      |  |  |_ User.java
  |      |_resources
  |      |  |_ com/mycompany/Domain.gwt.xml
  |_webapp
     |_src
     |  |_main
     |    |_java
     |    |  |_ com/mycompany/gwt/Module.gwt.xml // inherits Domain.gwt.xml
     |    |  |_ com/mycompany/gwt/client
     |    |  |  |_ ModuleEntryPoint.java
...
+---

  When using Eclipse-Maven integration like the m2eclipse plugin, other maven projects open in the
  workspace will be automagically resolved as projects (instead of JARs). When the referenced project is well
  configured (*) as a GWT module project, changes to java sources will be available in DevMode with a simple
  refresh with no requirement to repackage the modules.

  (*) A "<well configured GWT module project>" is expected to have Java sources copied as resources in the project
  build outputDirectory (using gwt:resource goal) and a dedicated gwt.xml module file to define the required
  inherits.

  The gwt-maven-plugin <<<src/it/reactor>>> project can be reviewed as a demonstrating sample of this setup.
