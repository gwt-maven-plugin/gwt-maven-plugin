The documentation for **Mojo's Maven Plugin for GWT** is here: https://gwt-maven-plugin.github.io/gwt-maven-plugin/

**NOTICE** There is a [new plugin][ng] ([archetypes][archetype] and [eclipse integration][eclipse]), a fresh start 
that correctly support multi-module projects, it is not version-bounded with GWT, support multiples GWT versions and 
other fixes, improvements and best practices. This plugin is now considered the `legacy GWT maven plugin` (aka **mojo**
GWT maven plugin) and the new one is considered the `new generation GWT maven plugin` (aka **tbroyer** GWT maven 
plugin). The legacy maven plugin is still supported but it is strongly encouraged to use the new one for new projects.
